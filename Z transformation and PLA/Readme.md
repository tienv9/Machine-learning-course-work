# PLA and Z-space transformation  (A total of 200 points)
__CSCD439/539 Machine Learning, Department of Computer Science and Electrical Engineering, Eastern Washington University, Spokane, Washington__

This programming assignment has two main components: 

* An efficient algorithm that transforms a given sample set to one that lives in a high degree space. 
* The perceptron learning algorithm (PLA) that supports the pocket version and the Z-space transformation. 


## Z-space transformation (100 points)

Finish the `z_transform(X, degree = 2)` function in the enclosed `utils.py` file. 
This function takes and transforms an $n \times d$ matrix, which represents the $n$ samples from the $X$ space where each sample has $d$ features, into another matrix $Z$ of dimension size $n \times d'$ that represents the transformed samples in the $Z$ space, where each sample had $d'$ features. Please refer to the lecture slides for the pseudocode of the algorithm that implements this function well. 

If your code is correct, it will produce a new matrix such that the following is always held between the values of $d$ and $d'$:

$$
d' = \sum_{i=1}^{degree}\binom{i+d-1}{d-1}
$$

Given the matrix $X$ and the degree of the $Z$ space that you want to go to, the matrix $Z$ is determined. Your code inside the body of `z_transform(X, degree = 2)` is to compute $Z$ and return it. Make sure your code works for any $n\geq 1$, any $d\geq 1$, and any $degree \geq 1$. Below are a few example results. 


### Example 1: 
If
```
X =
       [[1]
        [2]
        [3]]
```

Then: 
- `z_transform(X, degree = 1)` should produce and return
```
 [[1]
 [2]
 [3]]
```
- `z_transform(X, degree = 2)` should produce and return
``` 
[[1 1]
 [2 4]
 [3 9]]
```
- `z_transform(X, degree = 3)` should produce and return
```
[[ 1  1  1]
 [ 2  4  8]
 [ 3  9 27]]
``` 
- `z_transform(X, degree = 4)` should produce and return
``` 
[[ 1  1  1  1]
 [ 2  4  8 16]
 [ 3  9 27 81]]
 ```
- `z_transform(X, degree = 5)` should produce and return
``` 
[[  1   1   1   1   1]
 [  2   4   8  16  32]
 [  3   9  27  81 243]]
```

If
```
  X =
         [[1 2]
          [2 3]
          [3 4]]
```

-  `z_transform(X, degree = 1)` should produce and return 

```
    [[1 2]
     [2 3]
     [3 4]]
```

- `z_transform(X, degree = 2)` should produce and return

```
    [[ 1  2  1  2  4]
     [ 2  3  4  6  9]
     [ 3  4  9 12 16]]
```

- `z_transform(X, degree = 3)` should produce and return 

```
    [[ 1  2  1  2  4  1  2  4  8]
     [ 2  3  4  6  9  8 12 18 27]
     [ 3  4  9 12 16 27 36 48 64]]
```
 
- `z_transform(X, degree = 4)` should produce and return

## PLA and its pocket version (100 points)

This component is to finish the code for the `PLA` class in the `pla.py` file. Please go to that file for further instructions there. 
Note that the class `PLA` does not assume any particular value for $N$ (the training sample set size), and does not assume any particular value for $d$ (the number of features in each sample). In other words, your code shall be working for any $N\geq 1$ and any $d\geq 1$. 



## Other enclosed miscellaneous files

* `test_pla-v2.ipynb`: a notebook that you can use (but don't have to if you want to have your own) for quick testing/playing with your code. This notebook for testing/playing only supports degree up to 4 (due to my not having time to code out the generic form for the plotting part; you feel free to change it), but the `z_transform` function itself needs to support any `degree`$\geq1$. 

* `handy_plot.ipynb`: This file has a few cells that show you how to plot dots, equations, lines, etc., using ``matplotlib``. This is only for your convenience in case you want plot your own data and the found cutting line, for visualization or simply for amusement. Please know that you have no way to plot high-dimensional data. Feel free to research for various ways to do data plotting. 


## You only need to submit the following files: 

* `utils.py`
* `pla.py`

Zip them into `pla.zip` and submit the zip file onto Canvas. 
We (the TA and myself) will use our own main module to test your code. 
You feel free to create your own main module and data sets for testing.
