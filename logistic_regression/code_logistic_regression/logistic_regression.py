            Compute the fitting weight vector and save it `in self.w`. 
         
            Parameters: 
                X: n x d matrix of samples; every sample has d features, excluding the bias feature. 
                y: n x 1 vector of lables. Every label is +1 or -1. 
                lam: the L2 parameter for regularization
                eta: the learning rate used in gradient descent
                iterations: the number of iterations used in GD/SGD. Each iteration is one epoch if batch GD is used. 
                SGD: True - use SGD; False: use batch GD
                mini_batch_size: the size of each mini batch size, if SGD is True.  
                degree: the degree of the Z space
